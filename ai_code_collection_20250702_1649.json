For example, the sum of the proper divisors of $28$ would be $1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28$, which means that $28$ is a perfect number.   A number $n$ is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than $n$ and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds $n$.   As $12$ is the smallest abundant number, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16$, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is $24$. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than $28123$ can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

			"description":"Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.   A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.   For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both \"halves\", it is impossible to decrypt the message.   Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.   Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters.

			"description":"If we are presented with the first $k$ terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.   As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function, $u_n = n^3$: $1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, \\dots$   Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that \"simple is best\" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be $15$ (common difference $7$). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.   We shall define $\\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ to be the $n$ th  term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first $k$ terms of a sequence. It should be clear that $\\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for $n \\le k$, and potentially the  first incorrect term  (FIT) will be $\\operatorname{OP}(k, k+1)$; in which case we shall call it a  bad OP  (BOP).

			"description":"As we all know the equation $x^2=-1$ has no solutions for real $x$.   If we however introduce the imaginary number $i$ this equation has two solutions: $x=i$ and $x=-i$.   If we go a step further the equation $(x-3)^2=-4$ has two complex solutions: $x=3+2i$ and $x=3-2i$.  $x=3+2i$ and $x=3-2i$ are called each others' complex conjugate.   Numbers of the form $a+bi$ are called complex numbers.   In general $a+bi$ and $a-bi$ are each other's complex conjugate.   A Gaussian Integer is a complex number $a+bi$ such that both $a$ and $b$ are integers.   The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with $b=0$).   To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with $b \\ne 0$ we call such integers \"rational integers.\"   A Gaussian integer $a+bi$ is called a divisor of a rational integer $n$ if the result $\\dfrac n {a + bi}$ is also a Gaussian integer.   If for example we divide $5$ by $1+2i$ we can simplify $\\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}$ in the following manner:   Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of $1+2i$: $1-2i$.   The result is $\\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i} = \\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}\\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \\dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (2i)^2} = \\dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (-4)} = \\dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{5} = 1 - 2i$.   So $1+2i$ is a divisor of $5$.   Note that $1+i$ is not a divisor of $5$ because $\\dfrac{5}{1 + i} = \\dfrac{5}{2} - \\dfrac{5}{2}i$.   Note also that if the Gaussian Integer $(a+bi)$ is a divisor of a rational integer $n$, then its complex conjugate $(a-bi)$ is also a divisor of $n$.   In fact, $5$ has six divisors such that the real part is positive: $\\{1, 1 + 2i, 1 - 2i, 2 + i, 2 - i, 5\\}$.   The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive rational integers:      $n$   Gaussian integer divisors  with positive real part  Sum $s(n)$ of  these divisors    $1$  $1$  $1$     $2$  $1, 1+i, 1-i, 2$  $5$     $3$  $1, 3$  $4$     $4$  $1, 1+i, 1-i, 2, 2+2i, 2-2i,4$  $13$     $5$  $1, 1+2i, 1-2i, 2+i, 2-i, 5$  $12$     For divisors with positive real parts, then, we have: $\\sum \\limits_{n = 1}^{5} {s(n)} = 35$.   $\\sum \\limits_{n = 1}^{10^5} {s(n)} = 17924657155$.

To this end, we generate $20000$ numbers using the so-called \"Blum Blum Shub\" pseudo-random number generator.  \\begin{align} s_0 &= 290797\\\\ s_{n + 1} &= s_n \\times s_n \\pmod{50515093}\\\\ t_n &= s_n \\pmod{500} \\end{align}  To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers $t_n$. That is, the first line segment is given by:   $(t_1, t_2)$ to $(t_3, t_4)$.   The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should be: $27$, $144$, $12$ and $232$. The first segment would thus be $(27,144)$ to $(12,232)$.   How many distinct true intersection points are found among the $5000$ line segments?",

			"description":"The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:   Generate two distinct primes $p$ and $q$. Compute $n = pq$ and $\\phi = (p - 1)(q - 1)$.  Find an integer $e$, $1 \\lt e \\lt \\phi$, such that $\\gcd(e, \\phi) = 1$.   A message in this system is a number in the interval $[0, n - 1]$.  A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in the interval $[0, n - 1]$).  To encrypt the text, for each message, $m$, $c = m^e \\bmod n$ is calculated.   To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate $d$ such that $ed = 1 \\bmod \\phi$, then for each encrypted message, $c$, calculate $m = c^d \\bmod n$.   There exist values of $e$ and $m$ such that $m^e \\bmod n = m$. We call messages $m$ for which $m^e \\bmod n = m$ unconcealed messages.   An issue when choosing $e$ is that there should not be too many unconcealed messages. For instance, let $p = 19$ and $q = 37$.  Then $n = 19 \\cdot 37 = 703$ and $\\phi = 18 \\cdot 36 = 648$.  If we choose $e = 181$, then, although $\\gcd(181,648) = 1$ it turns out that all possible messages $m$ ($0 \\le m \\le n - 1$) are unconcealed when calculating $m^e \\bmod n$.  For any valid choice of $e$ there exist some unconcealed messages.  It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.   Choose $p = 1009$ and $q = 3643$.  Find the sum of all values of $e$, $1 \\lt e \\lt \\phi(1009,3643)$ and $\\gcd(e, \\phi) = 1$, so that the number of unconcealed messages for this value of $e$ is at a minimum.",

For example, $(0,0,13)$, $(0,11,11)$, and $(5,5,5)$ are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones.   A  losing configuration  is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does.  For example, $(0,1,2)$ and $(1,3,3)$ are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.   Consider all losing configurations $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ where $x_i \\le y_i \\le z_i \\le 100$.  We can verify that $\\sum (x_i + y_i + z_i) = 173895$ for these.

			"description":"We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ by asking questions. Each number (question) we ask, has a  cost equal to the number asked  and we get one of three possible answers:     \"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\", or    \"Yes, that's it!\", or    \"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\".    Given the value of $n$, an  optimal strategy  minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked)  for the worst possible case . E.g.   If $n=3$, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number \" 2 \". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost $= 2$).   If $n=8$, we might decide to use a \"binary search\" type of strategy: Our first question would be \"$\\mathbf 4$\" and if the hidden number is higher than $4$ we will need one or two additional questions.  Let our second question be \"$\\mathbf 6$\". If the hidden number is still higher than $6$, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between $7$ and $8$.  Thus, our third question will be \"$\\mathbf 7$\" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be $4+6+7={\\color{red}\\mathbf{17}}$.   We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for $n=8$, by asking \"$\\mathbf 5$\" as our first question.  If we are told that the hidden number is higher than $5$, our second question will be \"$\\mathbf 7$\", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of $5+7={\\color{blue}\\mathbf{12}}$).  If we are told that the hidden number is lower than $5$, our second question will be \"$\\mathbf 3$\" and if the hidden number is lower than $3$ our third question will be \"$\\mathbf 1$\", giving a total cost of $5+3+1={\\color{blue}\\mathbf 9}$.  Since ${\\color{blue}\\mathbf{12}} \\gt {\\color{blue}\\mathbf 9}$, the worst-case cost for this strategy is ${\\color{red}\\mathbf{12}}$. That's better than what we achieved previously with the \"binary search\" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.  So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for $n=8$.   Let $C(n)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for $n$, as described above.  Thus $C(1) = 0$, $C(2) = 1$, $C(3) = 2$ and $C(8) = 12$.  Similarly, $C(100) = 400$ and $\\sum \\limits_{n = 1}^{100} C(n) = 17575$.   Find $\\sum \\limits_{n = 1}^{200000} C(n)$.",

			"description":"A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However, sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the correct order.   To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.  Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has been achieved.   However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the correct place, then carriage B, and so on.   Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall call  maximix arrangements , are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just three rotations).

			"description":"Each one of the $25$ sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known to affect $2\\%$ of the sheep population. An accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive \/ negative result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.     Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing $25$ separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:   The sheep are split into $5$ groups of $5$ sheep in each group. For each group, the $5$ samples are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,    If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.   If the result is positive, $5$ additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).     Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only $0.02$, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:    Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability $0.98^5 = 0.9039207968$.   Positive ($5$ additional tests needed) with probability $1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032$.     Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is $1 + 0.0960792032 \\times 5 = 1.480396016$.  Consequently, all $5$ groups can be screened using an average of only $1.480396016 \\times 5 = \\mathbf{7.40198008}$ tests, which represents a huge saving of more than $70\\%$!     Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:    We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the $25$ samples. It can be verified that in about $60.35\\%$ of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining $39.65\\%$ of the cases.   If we know that at least one animal in a group of $5$ is infected and the first $4$ individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).   We can try a different number of groups \/ different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.     To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected \/ virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.   For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the  optimal strategy ) requires an average of just $\\mathbf{4.155452}$ tests!   Using the optimal strategy, let $T(s,p)$ represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of $s$ sheep for a virus having probability $p$ to be present in any individual.  Thus, rounded to six decimal places, $T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452$ and $T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124$.     Find $\\sum T(10000, p)$ for $p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, \\dots 0.50$.

Given the value of $n$, $a$, and $b$, an  optimal strategy  minimizes the total cost  for the worst possible case .   For example, if $n = 5$, $a = 2$, and $b = 3$, then we may begin by asking \" 2 \" as our first question.   If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of  b =3), then we are sure that \" 1 \" is the hidden number (for a total cost of   3  ).  If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of  a =2), then our next question will be \" 4 \".  If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of  b =3), then we are sure that \" 3 \" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=  5  ).

			"description":"$6174$ is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in decreasing order, we get $7641-1467=6174$.  Even more remarkable is that if we start from any $4$ digit number and repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up with $6174$ or immediately with $0$ if all digits are equal.  This also works with numbers that have less than $4$ digits if we pad the number with leading zeroes until we have $4$ digits.  E.g. let's start with the number $0837$:  $8730-0378=8352$  $8532-2358=6174$     $6174$ is called the  Kaprekar constant . The process of sorting and subtracting and repeating this until either $0$ or the Kaprekar constant is reached is called the  Kaprekar routine .     We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits.  Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input numbers.  However, it can be shown that for $5$ digits and a base $b = 6t+3\\neq 9$, a Kaprekar constant exists.  E.g. base $15$: $(10,4,14,9,5)_{15}$  base $21$: $(14,6,20,13,7)_{21}$    Define $C_b$ to be the Kaprekar constant in base $b$ for $5$ digits.

Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from Â£1 to Â£$p$, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for all of the players to maximize the winnings of the ticket they hold upon leaving the game.   An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each player has only one of two options:     The player can choose to scratch the ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.   If the player's ticket is unscratched, then the player may trade it with a previous player's scratched ticket, and then leaves the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches the newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.     The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.   Assume that players will use the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of their ticket winnings.   Let $E(p)$ represent the expected number of players left at the table when the game ends in a game consisting of $p$ players.  E.g. $E(111) = 5.2912$ when rounded to 5 significant digits.

			"description":"Consider a single game of Ramvok:   Let $t$ represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If $t = 0$, then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn $i$, the player rolls a die. After rolling, if $i \\lt t$ the player can either stop the game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn. If $i = t$, then the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins, $t$ is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-front cost $ct$ for some constant $c$. For $c = 0$, $t$ can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of $0$). Let $R(d, c)$ be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair $d$-sided die and cost constant $c$. For example, $R(4, 0.2) = 2.65$. Assume that the player has sufficient funds for paying any\/all up-front costs.   Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:   In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces of the die are blank.   Let $S(d, c)$ be the expected profit that the player receives from an optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair $d$-sided die to start (with all sides visible), and cost constant $c$.

On each chef's turn, he\/she cooks up a dish to the best of his\/her ability and gives it to a separate panel of judges for taste-testing. Let $S(k)$ represent chef #$k$'s skill level (which is publicly known). More specifically, $S(k)$ is the probability that chef #$k$'s dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on any\/all turns). If the dish receives a favorable rating, then the chef must choose one other chef to be eliminated from the competition. The last chef remaining in the competition is the winner.   The game always begins with chef #$1$, with the turn order iterating sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is always the one with the next-closest turn.   Define $W_n(k)$ as the probability that chef #$k$ wins in a competition with $n$ chefs. If we have $S(1) = 0.25$, $S(2) = 0.5$, and $S(3) = 1$, then $W_3(1) = 0.29375$.

			"description":"Bob is very familiar with the famous mathematical puzzle\/game, \"Tower of Hanoi,\" which consists of three upright rods and disks of different sizes that can slide onto any of the rods. The game begins with a stack of $n$ disks placed on the leftmost rod in descending order by size. The objective of the game is to move all of the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod, given the following restrictions:    Only one disk can be moved at a time.   A valid move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it onto another stack (or an empty rod).   No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.    Moving on to a variant of this game, consider a long room $k$ units (square tiles) wide, labeled from $1$ to $k$ in ascending order. Three rods are placed at squares $a$, $b$, and $c$, and a stack of $n$ disks is placed on the rod at square $a$.   Bob begins the game standing at square $b$. His objective is to play the Tower of Hanoi game by moving all of the disks to the rod at square $c$. However, Bob can only pick up or set down a disk if he is on the same square as the rod\/stack in question.   Unfortunately, Bob is also drunk. On a given move, Bob will either stumble one square to the left or one square to the right with equal probability, unless Bob is at either end of the room, in which case he can only move in one direction. Despite Bob's inebriated state, he is still capable of following the rules of the game itself, as well as choosing when to pick up or put down a disk.   The following animation depicts a side-view of a sample game for $n = 3$, $k = 7$, $a = 2$, $b = 4$, and $c = 6$:       Let $E(n, k, a, b, c)$ be the expected number of squares that Bob travels during a single optimally-played game. A game is played optimally if the number of disk-pickups is minimized.   Interestingly enough, the result is always an integer. For example, $E(2,5,1,3,5) = 60$ and $E(3,20,4,9,17) = 2358$.

			"description":"Despite the popularity of Hilbert's infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to try managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.   To cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.   Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.   For example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:       If the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can  receive  power from many other floors at once, it can only  send  power to one other floor.   To resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.   Let $F(n)$ be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of $n$ floors. For example, $F(3) = 6$, $F(8) = 16276736$, and $F(100) \\bmod 135707531 = 84326147$.   Find $F(12344321) \\bmod 135707531$.",

			"description":"A secret integer $t$ is selected at random within the range $1 \\le t \\le n$.    The goal is to guess the value of $t$ by making repeated guesses, via integer $g$. After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either $g \\lt t$, $g = t$, or $g \\gt t$. Then the process can repeat as necessary.   Normally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound $L$ and upper bound $H$ (initialized to $L = 1$ and $H = n$), let $g = \\lfloor(L+H)\/2\\rfloor$ where $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$ is the integer floor function. If $g = t$, the process ends. Otherwise, if $g \\lt t$, set $L = g+1$, but if $g \\gt t$ instead, set $H = g - 1$. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once $t$ is found. Even if $t$ can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.   Your friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting $g = \\lfloor(L+H)\/2\\rfloor$, simply let $g$ be a random integer between $L$ and $H$, inclusive. The rest of the algorithm is the same as the standard binary search. This new search routine will be referred to as a  random binary search .   Given that $1 \\le t \\le n$ for random $t$, let $B(n)$ be the expected number of guesses needed to find $t$ using the standard binary search, and let $R(n)$ be the expected number of guesses needed to find $t$ using the random binary search.

For example, a weak queen on an $n \\times n$ board with a weakness factor of $w=1$ located in the bottom row will not be able to threaten any square in the top row as the weak queen would need to move $n - 1$ squares vertically or diagonally to get there, but may only move $n - 2$ squares in these directions. In contrast, the weak queen is not handicapped horizontally, thus threatening every square in its own row, independently from its current position in that row.   Let $Q(n,w)$ be the number of ways $n$ weak queens with weakness factor $w$ can be placed on an $n \\times n$ board so that no two queens threaten each other. It can be shown, for example, that $Q(4,0)=2$, $Q(4,2)=16$ and $Q(4,3)=256$.   Let $S(n)=\\displaystyle\\sum_{w=0}^{n-1} Q(n,w)$.   You are given that $S(4)=276$ and $S(5)=3347$.   Find $S(14)$.",

			"description":"A  Gaussian integer  is a number $z = a + bi$ where $a$, $b$ are integers and $i^2 = -1$.  Gaussian integers are a subset of the complex numbers, and the integers are the subset of Gaussian integers for which $b = 0$.   A Gaussian integer  unit  is one for which $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, i.e. one of $1, i, -1, -i$.  Let's define a  proper  Gaussian integer as one for which $a \\gt 0$ and $b \\ge 0$.   A Gaussian integer $z_1 = a_1 + b_1 i$ is said to be divisible by $z_2 = a_2 + b_2 i$ if $z_3 = a_3 + b_3 i = z_1 \/ z_2$ is a Gaussian integer.  $\\frac {z_1} {z_2} = \\frac {a_1 + b_1 i} {a_2 + b_2 i} = \\frac {(a_1 + b_1 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} {(a_2 + b_2 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} = \\frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2} + \\frac {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}i = a_3 + b_3 i$  So, $z_1$ is divisible by $z_2$ if $\\frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ and $\\frac {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ are integers.  For example, $2$ is divisible by $1 + i$ because $2\/(1 + i) = 1 - i$ is a Gaussian integer.   A  Gaussian prime  is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit, itself or itself times a unit.  For example, $1 + 2i$ is a Gaussian prime, because it is only divisible by $1$, $i$, $-1$, $-i$, $1 + 2i$, $i(1 + 2i) = i - 2$, $-(1 + 2i) = -1 - 2i$ and $-i(1 + 2i) = 2 - i$.  $2$ is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by $1 + i$.   A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and proper Gaussian primes.  For example $2 = -i(1 + i)^2$ and $1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i)$.  A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization does not contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.  So $2$ is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but $1 + 3i$ is.  Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.   Let $f(n)$ be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with $a^2 + b^2 \\le n$.  For example $f(10) = 7$ because $1$, $1 + i$, $1 + 2i$, $1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i)$, $2 + i$, $3$ and $3 + i = -i(1 + i)(1 + 2i)$ are squarefree, while $2 = -i(1 + i)^2$ and $2 + 2i = -i(1 + i)^3$ are not.

			"description":"A company specialises in producing large rectangular metal sheets, starting from unit square metal plates. The welding is performed by a range of robots of increasing size. Unfortunately, the programming options of these robots are rather limited. Each one can only process up to $25$ identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either edge to produce a larger rectangle. The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including $25$), and whether to weld the long or short edge.   For example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together $11$ raw unit square plates to make a $11 \\times 1$ strip. The next could take $10$ of these $11 \\times 1$ strips, and weld them either to make a longer $110 \\times 1$ strip, or a $11 \\times 10$ rectangle. Many, but not all, possible dimensions of metal sheets can be constructed in this way.   One regular customer has a particularly unusual order: The finished product should have an exact area, and the long side must not be more than $10\\%$ larger than the short side. If these requirements can be met in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two sides, then the customer will demand that all variants be produced. For example, if the order calls for a metal sheet of area $889200$, then there are three final dimensions that can be produced: $900 \\times 988$, $912 \\times 975$ and $936 \\times 950$. The target area of $889200$ is the smallest area which can be manufactured in three different variants, within the limitations of the robot welders.   Let $M(n)$ be the minimal area that can be manufactured in  exactly  $n$ variants with the longer edge not greater than $10\\%$ bigger than the shorter edge. Hence $M(3) = 889200$.

The product $AB$ is divisible by every prime less than q.    It can be shown that, given these conditions, any sum $A+B<q^2$ and any difference $1<A-B<q^2$ has to be a prime number. Thus you can verify that a number $p$ is prime by showing that either $p=A+B<q^2$ or $p=A-B<q^2$ for some $A,B,q$ fulfilling the conditions listed above.   Let $V(p)$ be the smallest possible value of $A$ in any sum $p=A+B$ and any difference $p=A-B$, that verifies $p$ being prime.

Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms.

The description further instructed them to enter the answer into the device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.   After traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka.

			"description":"Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear love the game of Poohsticks so much that they invented a new version which allows them to play for longer before one of them wins and they have to go home for tea. The game starts as normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water, and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other one having also 'lapped' the other stick - that is, having made one additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.     On a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks' journey time is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds (inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under the bridge having lapped the other.     The stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the integers from a minimum, $n$, to a maximum, $m$, inclusive. Let the expected time of play in seconds be $E(m,n)$. Hence $E(60,30)=1036.15...$     Let $S(k)=\\sum_{m=2}^k\\sum_{n=1}^{m-1}E(m,n)$.     For example $S(5)=7722.82$ rounded to 2 decimal places.

			"description":"The Torpids are rowing races held annually in Oxford, following some curious rules:    A division consists of $n$ boats (typically 13), placed in order based on past performance.    All boats within a division start at 40 metre intervals along the river, in order with the highest-placed boat starting furthest upstream.    The boats all start rowing simultaneously, upstream, trying to catch the boat in front while avoiding being caught by boats behind.    Each boat continues rowing until  either  it reaches the finish line  or  it catches up with (\"bumps\") a boat in front.    The finish line is a distance $L$ metres (the course length, in reality about 1800 metres) upstream from the starting position of the lowest-placed boat. (Because of the staggered starting positions, higher-placed boats row a slightly shorter course than lower-placed boats.)    When a \"bump\" occurs, the \"bumping\" boat takes no further part in the race. The \"bumped\" boat must continue, however, and may even be \"bumped\" again by boats that started two or more places behind it.    After the race, boats are assigned new places within the division, based on the bumps that occurred. Specifically, for any boat $A$ that started in a lower place than $B$, then $A$ will be placed higher than $B$ in the new order if and only if one of the following occurred:    $A$ bumped $B$ directly     $A$ bumped another boat that went on to bump $B$     $A$ bumped another boat, that bumped yet another boat, that bumped $B$     etc      NOTE : For the purposes of this problem you may disregard the boats' lengths, and assume that a bump occurs precisely when the two boats draw level. (In reality, a bump is awarded as soon as physical contact is made, which usually occurs when there is much less than a full boat length's overlap.)   Suppose that, in a particular race, each boat $B_j$ rows at a steady speed $v_j = -$log$X_j$ metres per second, where the $X_j$ are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) between 0 and 1, independently from one another. These speeds are relative to the riverbank: you may disregard the flow of the river.     Let $p(n,L)$ be the probability that the new order is an  even permutation  of the starting order, when there are $n$ boats in the division and $L$ is the course length.     For example, with $n=3$ and $L=160$, labelling the boats as $A$,$B$,$C$ in starting order with $C$ highest, the different possible outcomes of the race are as follows:       Bumps occurring     New order     Permutation     Probability       none     $A$, $B$, $C$     even     $4\/15$       $B$ bumps $C$     $A$, $C$, $B$     odd     $8\/45$       $A$ bumps $B$     $B$, $A$, $C$     odd     $1\/3$       $B$ bumps $C$, then $A$ bumps $C$     $C$, $A$, $B$     even     $4\/27$       $A$ bumps $B$, then $B$ bumps $C$     $C$, $B$, $A$     odd     $2\/27$       Therefore, $p(3,160) = 4\/15 + 4\/27 = 56\/135$.

			"description":"Alice enlists the help of some friends to generate a random number, using a single unfair coin. She and her friends sit around a table and, starting with Alice, they take it in turns to toss the coin. Everyone keeps a count of how many heads they obtain individually. The process ends as soon as Alice obtains a Head. At this point, Alice multiplies all her friends' Head counts together to obtain her random number.     As an illustration, suppose Alice is assisted by Bob, Charlie, and Dawn, who are seated round the table in that order, and that they obtain the sequence of Head\/Tail outcomes  THHHâTTTTâTHHTâH  beginning and ending with Alice. Then Bob and Charlie each obtain 2 heads, and Dawn obtains 1 head. Alice's random number is therefore $2\\times 2\\times 1 = 4$.     Define $e(n, p)$ to be the expected value of Alice's random number, where $n$ is the number of friends helping (excluding Alice herself), and $p$ is the probability of the coin coming up Tails.     It turns out that, for any fixed $n$, $e(n, p)$ is always a polynomial in $p$. For example, $e(3, p) = p^3 + 4p^2 + p$.     Define $c(n, k)$ to be the coefficient of $p^k$ in the polynomial $e(n, p)$. So $c(3, 1) = 1$, $c(3, 2) = 4$, and $c(3, 3) = 1$.

Four other distinct circles, which we call \"planets\", with circumferences $p$, $p$, $q$, $q$ centimetres respectively ($p<q$), are inscribed within $C$ but outside $S$, with each planet touching both $C$ and $S$ tangentially. The planets are permitted to overlap one another, but the boundaries of $S$ and $C$ must be at least 1cm apart at their closest point.   Now suppose that these circles are actually gears with perfectly meshing teeth at a pitch of 1cm. $C$ is an internal gear with teeth on the inside. We require that $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$ are all integers (as they are the numbers of teeth), and we further stipulate that any gear must have at least 5 teeth.   Note that \"perfectly meshing\" means that as the gears rotate, the ratio between their angular velocities remains constant, and the teeth of one gear perfectly align with the groves of the other gear and vice versa. Only for certain gear sizes and positions will it be possible for $S$ and $C$ each to mesh perfectly with all the planets. Arrangements where not all gears mesh perfectly are not valid.   Define $g(c,s,p,q)$ to be the number of such gear arrangements for given values of $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$: it turns out that this is finite as only certain discrete arrangements are possible satisfying the above conditions.

			"description":"The  lambda-calculus  is a universal model of computation at the core of functional programming languages. It is based on  lambda-terms , a minimal programming language featuring only function definitions, function calls and variables. Lambda-terms are built according to the following rules:     Any  variable  $x$ (single letter, from some infinite alphabet) is a lambda-term.   If $M$ and $N$ are lambda-terms, then $(M N)$ is a lambda-term, called the  application  of $M$ to $N$.   If $x$ is a variable and $M$ is a term, then $(\\lambda x. M)$ is a lambda-term, called an  abstraction . An abstraction defines an anonymous function, taking $x$ as parameter and sending back $M$.     A lambda-term $T$ is said to be  closed  if for all variables $x$, all occurrences of $x$ within $T$ are contained within some abstraction $(\\lambda x. M)$ in $T$. The smallest such abstraction is said to  bind  the occurrence of the variable $x$. In other words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to parameters of enclosing functions definitions. For example, the term $(\\lambda x. x)$ is closed, while the term $(\\lambda x. (x y))$ is not because $y$ is not bound.   Also, we can rename variables as long as no binding abstraction changes. This means that $(\\lambda x. x)$ and $(\\lambda y. y)$ should be considered equivalent since we merely renamed a parameter. Two terms equivalent modulo such renaming are called  $\\alpha$-equivalent . Note that $(\\lambda x. (\\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\\lambda x. (\\lambda x. (x x)))$ are not $\\alpha$-equivalent, since the abstraction binding the first variable was the outer one and becomes the inner one. However, $(\\lambda x. (\\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\\lambda y. (\\lambda x. (y x)))$ are $\\alpha$-equivalent.   The following table regroups the lambda-terms that can be written with at most $15$ symbols, symbols being parenthesis, $\\lambda$, dot and variables.  \\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \\hline (\\lambda x.x) & (\\lambda x.(x x)) & (\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.x)) & (\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.y)) \\\\ \\hline (\\lambda x.(x (x x))) & (\\lambda x.((x x) x)) & (\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.(x x))) & (\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.(x y))) \\\\ \\hline (\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.(y x))) & (\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.(y y))) & (\\lambda x.(x (\\lambda y.x))) & (\\lambda x.(x (\\lambda y.y))) \\\\ \\hline (\\lambda x.((\\lambda y.x) x)) & (\\lambda x.((\\lambda y.y) x)) & ((\\lambda x.x) (\\lambda x.x)) & (\\lambda x.(x (x (x x)))) \\\\ \\hline (\\lambda x.(x ((x x) x))) & (\\lambda x.((x x) (x x))) & (\\lambda x.((x (x x)) x)) & (\\lambda x.(((x x) x) x)) \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\]  Let be $\\Lambda(n)$ the number of distinct closed lambda-terms that can be written using at most $n$ symbols, where terms that are $\\alpha$-equivalent to one another should be counted only once.

The statement above is true for pentagonal, heptagonal and in fact any $k$-gonal number with $k$ odd. For example when $k=5$ we get the pentagonal numbers and we can find positive integers $A$ and $B$ such that given any pentagonal number, $P_n$, then $AP_n+B$ is always a pentagonal number. We define $F_5(N)$ to be the sum of $(A+B)$ over all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\\max(A,B)\\le N$.     Similarly we define $F_k(N)$ for odd $k$. You are given $\\sum_{k} F_k(10^3) = 14993$ where the sum is over all odd $k = 3,5,7,\\ldots$.     Find $\\sum_{k} F_k(10^{12})$ where the sum is over all odd $k = 3,5,7,\\ldots$",

			"description":"Alice and Bob are taking turns playing a game consisting of $c$ different coins on a chessboard of size $n$ by $n$.  The game may start with any arrangement of $c$ coins in squares on the board. It is possible at any time for more than one coin to occupy the same square on the board at the same time. The coins are distinguishable, so swapping two coins gives a different arrangement if (and only if) they are on different squares.   On a given turn, the player must choose a coin and move it either left or up $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$ spaces in a single direction. The only restriction is that the coin cannot move off the edge of the board.   The game ends when a player is unable to make a valid move, thereby granting the other player the victory.   Assuming that Alice goes first and that both players are playing optimally, let $M(n, c)$ be the number of possible starting arrangements for which Alice can ensure her victory, given a board of size $n$ by $n$ with $c$ distinct coins.

			"description":"Consider a horizontal frictionless tube with length $L$ millimetres, and a diameter of 20 millimetres. The east end of the tube is open, while the west end is sealed. The tube contains $N$ marbles of diameter 20 millimetres at designated starting locations, each one initially moving either westward or eastward with common speed $v$.   Since there are marbles moving in opposite directions, there are bound to be some collisions. We assume that the collisions are perfectly elastic, so both marbles involved instantly change direction and continue with speed $v$ away from the collision site. Similarly, if the west-most marble collides with the sealed end of the tube, it instantly changes direction and continues eastward at speed $v$. On the other hand, once a marble reaches the unsealed east end, it exits the tube and has no further interaction with the remaining marbles.   To obtain the starting positions and initial directions, we use the pseudo-random sequence $r_j$ defined by:  $r_1 = 6\\,563\\,116$  $r_{j+1} = r_j^2 \\bmod 32\\,745\\,673$  The west-most marble is initially positioned with a gap of $(r_1 \\bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres between it and the sealed end of the tube, measured from the west-most point of the surface of the marble. Then, for $2\\le j\\le N$, counting from the west, the gap between the $(j-1)$th and $j$th marbles, as measured from their closest points, is given by $(r_j \\bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres. Furthermore, the $j$th marble is initially moving eastward if $r_j \\le 10\\,000\\,000$, and westward if $r_j > 10\\,000\\,000$.   For example, with $N=3$, the sequence specifies gaps of 117, 432, and 173 millimetres. The marbles'  centres  are therefore 127, 579, and 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.   Under this setup, and with a five metre tube ($L=5000$), it turns out that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.   Let $d(L, N, j)$ be the distance in millimetres that the $j$th marble travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube. So $d(5000, 3, 2) = 5519$.

			"description":"At Euler University, each of the $n$ students (numbered from 1 to $n$) occupies a bed in the dormitory and uses a desk in the classroom.   Some of the beds are in private rooms which a student occupies alone, while the others are in double rooms occupied by two students as roommates. Similarly, each desk is either a single desk for the sole use of one student, or a twin desk at which two students sit together as desk partners.   We represent the bed and desk sharing arrangements each by a list of pairs of student numbers. For example, with $n=4$, if $(2,3)$ represents the bed pairing and $(1,3)(2,4)$ the desk pairing, then students 2 and 3 are roommates while 1 and 4 have single rooms, and students 1 and 3 are desk partners, as are students 2 and 4.   The new chancellor of the university decides to change the organisation of beds and desks: a permutation $\\sigma$ of the numbers $1,2,\\ldots,n$ will be chosen, and each student $k$ will be given both the bed and the desk formerly occupied by student number $\\sigma(k)$.   The students agree to this change, under the conditions that:     Any two students currently sharing a room will still be roommates.   Any two students currently sharing a desk will still be desk partners.     In the example above, there are only two ways to satisfy these conditions: either take no action ($\\sigma$ is the  identity permutation ), or reverse the order of the students.   With $n=6$, for the bed pairing $(1,2)(3,4)(5,6)$ and the desk pairing $(3,6)(4,5)$, there are 8 permutations which satisfy the conditions. One example is the mapping $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \\mapsto (1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4)$.   With $n=36$, if we have bed pairing:  $(2,13)(4,30)(5,27)(6,16)(10,18)(12,35)(14,19)(15,20)(17,26)(21,32)(22,33)(24,34)(25,28)$  and desk pairing  $(1,35)(2,22)(3,36)(4,28)(5,25)(7,18)(9,23)(13,19)(14,33)(15,34)(20,24)(26,29)(27,30)$  then among the $36!$ possible permutations (including the identity permutation), 663552 of them satisfy the conditions stipulated by the students.   The downloadable text files  beds.txt  and  desks.txt  contain pairings for $n=500$. Each pairing is written on its own line, with the student numbers of the two roommates (or desk partners) separated with a comma. For example, the desk pairing in the $n=4$ example above would be represented in this file format as:    1,3 2,4    With these pairings, find the number of permutations that satisfy the students' conditions.

The last player remaining is the winner and receives the entire contents of the pot.   At the beginning of a round, each die is given to a randomly selected player. A round then consists of a number of turns.   During each turn, each of the two players with a die rolls it.

At which point that player is immediately eliminated and has to pay $s^2$ where $s$ is the number of completed turns in this round.

It should also be noted that elements are not restricted to single digits. For example, $(3, 2, 13, 6, 13, 2, 3)$ is a valid twopal.

			"description":"Two friends, a runner and a swimmer, are playing a sporting game: The swimmer is swimming within a circular pool while the runner moves along the pool edge. While the runner tries to catch the swimmer at the very moment that the swimmer leaves the pool, the swimmer tries to reach the edge before the runner arrives there. They start the game with the swimmer located in the middle of the pool, while the runner is located anywhere at the edge of the pool.   We assume that the swimmer can move with any velocity up to $1$ in any direction and the runner can move with any velocity up to $v$ in either direction around the edge of the pool. Moreover we assume that both players can react immediately to any change of movement of their opponent.   Assuming optimal strategy of both players, it can be shown that the swimmer can always win by escaping the pool at some point at the edge before the runner gets there, if $v$ is less than the critical speed $V_{Circle} \\approx 4.60333885$ and can never win if $v>V_{Circle}$.   Now the two players play the game in a perfectly square pool. Again the swimmer starts in the middle of the pool, while the runner starts at the midpoint of one of the edges of the pool. It can be shown that the critical maximal speed of the runner below which the swimmer can always escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer when trying to leave the pool is $V_{Square} \\approx 5.78859314$.   At last, both players decide to play the game in a pool in the form of regular hexagon. Giving the same conditions as above, with the swimmer starting in the middle of the pool and the runner at the midpoint of one of the edges of the pool, find the critical maximal speed $V_{Hexagon}$ of the runner, below which the swimmer can always escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer.

			"description":"This problem combines the game of Nim with the Towers of Hanoi. For a brief introduction to the rules of these games, please refer to  Problem 301  and  Problem 497 , respectively.   The unique shortest solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem with $n$ disks and $3$ pegs requires $2^n-1$ moves. Number the positions in the solution from index 0 (starting position, all disks on the first peg) to index $2^n-1$ (final position, all disks on the third peg).   Each of these $2^n$ positions can be considered as the starting configuration for a game of Nim, in which two players take turns to select a peg and remove any positive number of disks from it. The winner is the player who removes the last disk.   We define $f(n)$ to be the sum of the indices of those positions for which, when considered as a Nim game, the first player will lose (assuming an optimal strategy from both players).   For $n=4$, the indices of losing positions in the shortest solution are 3,6,9 and 12. So we have $f(4) = 30$.   You are given that $f(10) = 67518$.   Find $f(10^5)$.

However, it is not necessary to do so. Another solution that does not use the $7$ is:  $$211 = (25â2)\\times (6+3) + 4$$  Define the  score  of a solution to be the sum of the numbers used. In the above example problem, the two given solutions have scores $47$ and $40$ respectively. It turns out that this problem has no solutions with score less than $40$.

			"description":"Using only a six-sided fair dice and a five-sided fair dice, we would like to emulate an $n$-sided fair dice.   For example, one way to emulate a 28-sided dice is to follow this procedure:     Roll both dice, obtaining integers $1\\le p\\le 6$ and $1\\le q\\le 5$.   Combine them using $r = 5(p-1) + q$ to obtain an integer $1\\le r\\le 30$.   If $r\\le 28$, return the value $r$ and stop.   Otherwise ($r$ being 29 or 30), roll both dice again, obtaining integers $1\\le s\\le 6$ and $1\\le t\\le 5$.   Compute $u = 30(r-29) + 5(s-1) + t$ to obtain an integer $1\\le u\\le 60$.   If $u>4$, return the value $((u-5)\\bmod 28) + 1$ and stop.   Otherwise (with $1\\le u\\le 4$), roll the six-sided dice twice, obtaining integers $1\\le v\\le 6$ and $1\\le w\\le 6$.   Compute $x = 36(u-1) + 6(v-1) + w$ to obtain an integer $1\\le x\\le 144$.   If $x>4$, return the value $((x-5)\\bmod 28) + 1$ and stop.   Otherwise (with $1\\le x\\le 4$), assign $u:=x$ and go back to step 7.     The expected number of dice rolls in following this procedure is 2.142476 (rounded to 6 decimal places). Note that rolling both dice at the same time is still counted as two dice rolls.   There exist other more complex procedures for emulating a 28-sided dice that entail a smaller average number of dice rolls. However, the above procedure has the attractive property that the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined: regardless of the outcome, it follows (D5,D6,D5,D6,D6,D6,D6,...), truncated wherever the process stops. In fact, amongst procedures for $n=28$ with this restriction, this one is optimal in the sense of minimising the expected number of rolls needed.   Different values of $n$ will in general use different predetermined sequences. For example, for $n=8$, the sequence (D5,D5,D5,...) gives an optimal procedure, taking 2.083333... dice rolls on average.   Define $R(n)$ to be the expected number of dice rolls for an optimal procedure for emulating an $n$-sided dice using only a five-sided and a six-sided dice, considering only those procedures where the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined.

Define the following L-expressions:     $C_0 = Z$;   $C_i = S(C_{i - 1})$ for $i \\ge 1$;   $D_i = C_i(S)(S)$.      For natural numbers $a, b, c, d, e$, let $F(a, b, c, d, e)$ denote the result of the L-expression $D_a(D_b)(D_c)(C_d)(A)(e)$ after applying all possible rules.    Find the last nine digits of $F(12, 345678, 9012345, 678, 90)$.    Note:  it can be proved that the L-expression in question can only be transformed a finite number of times, and the final result does not depend on the order of the transformations.",
